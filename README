I wrote this for my final project in a GUI class.  The code is pretty decent,
but there are a bunch of things that don't work quite right.  I think the most
valuable part of this is that it is a good non-trivial example of using
pygobject and pycairo.  The canvas and component widgets are all drawn
programatically using pycairo.

Files
-----
    * plumber.py - Main program file.
    * components.py - Implements individual components.
    * gui.xml - GtkBuilder XML interface description.

Requirements
------------

You need Python 2.6 or greater (Python 3 works).  On Ubuntu, you can install
the following packages:

    * python-gobject
    * python-cairo
    * python-gobject-cairo

On Arch Linux, install the following packages:

    * python-gobject
    * python-cairo

Then just run "python plumber.py"
